# 📊 Bank Marketing Term Deposit Prediction using SVM



# 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit based on various demographic, contact, and economic factors.
We utilize Support Vector Machine (SVM) modeling techniques to perform binary classification on the Portuguese Bank Marketing Dataset.

The project is structured to enable easy data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

#  📊 Dataset Description

The Bank Marketing Dataset contains the following types of attributes:
	•	Bank client data (e.g., age, job, marital status, education)
	•	Contact details (e.g., last contact month, day, communication type)
	•	Previous campaign outcomes
	•	Economic indicators (e.g., employment variation rate, consumer price index)

Detailed descriptions for all variables can be found in the Variables Overview section below.
